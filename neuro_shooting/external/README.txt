If you want anode intergrator support simply clone the anode directory:

git clone https://github.com/amirgholami/anode.git

Then put a link to the anode directory inside anode here.
I.e., if anode is in directory /users/me/anode

link to it by executing the following command in the directory of this README.txt file

ln -s  /users/me/anode/anode .

Keep in mind that anode is GPL3. Hence, if you include it / use it in the neuro_shooting repository it will also become GPL3.
