Tensorboard shooting hooks
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module provides some example hooks that can be used to create tensorboard outputs for example of the parameters of a shooting model. Using those can dramatically slow down runtime, so this is not recommended when really training models, or only very intermittently.
